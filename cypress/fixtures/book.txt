FIRST VICTORY
poem


From the history
Instead of a prologue

1

...Steppes, lathered with feather grass.
The Bashkirs trample the steppe with a steppe horse.

With a boom and a whistle, like a galloping wind,
Flies Hamidzham - Atach.

Liberty is burning, like a saber whistling,
And the humble month hung down to the ground.

How the steppe was torn with a dagger
The blue of the waters, the foam of the waves of the Urals.

Puluvan, donâ€™t jump over the mound,
Behind the mound lies deception.
